Live BGP Statistics
                                         
This system is complementary to PHP Looking Glass NG. It cannot work on its own.
It's intended to be used for troubleshooting and visualization of Wireless Community Networks using BGP for their backbone routing.
It's not tested on the full internet BGP table. Probably it won't work properly since it's not optimized for such large BGP tables.

It uses the routers database from PHP Looking Glass NG to connect to each router and periodically fetch the whole BGP routing table.
It then calculates all the BGP Peers for each AS on the network and shows them in easy to interpret representation.
Currently only Quagga and Mikrotik routers are supported.


It also lists all the collected data in searchable tables for easier network troubleshooting.

And by consulting the WiND Database it will create a list of illegally announced prefixes on the network.


Requirements:

PHP Looking Glass NG https://github.com/cha0sgr/php-looking-glass-ng
WiND https://github.com/wind-project/wind
Tested on Ubuntu and Fedora. It should work just fine on any other distro as well.
PHP 5.2+
MySQL 5.1+
phpseclib ://phpseclib.sourceforge.net/
Shell Access (to run the bgpcollect.php script)
GNU screen (to keep running the bgpcollect.php script and still have access to its output for troubleshooting)
